<p> One of the most difficult things as a visual designer is understanding your design style. We often run into creative slumps <br>
  that prevent our creativity to flourish. During those moments, the best thing to do is to refer to other people's work for <br>
  inspiration. However, it is also important to pay attention to your own style and find inspiration that will move it in the <br>
  right direction. I've been a visual designer for 5 years. During those years, I put a lot of effort into exploring visual styles <br>
  and techniques. I realized that my design style is catered to minimalism and typography. I work a lot with a monochromatic <br>
  color palette to visualize my imagery. Creating sleek and clean work is something I thoroughly enjoy doing. So when I <br>
  experience a creative slump, I am researching other minimalist work to create a spark in me.
