<p class="copy"> One of the most difficult things as a visual designer is understanding your design style. We often run <br>
  into creative slumps that prevent our creativity to flourish. During those moments, the best thing to do <br>
  is to refer to other people's work for inspiration. However, it is also important to pay attention to your <br>
  own style and find inspiration that will move it in the right direction. I've been a visual designer for 5 <br>
  years. During those years, I put a lot of effort into exploring visual styles and techniques. I realized that <br>
  my design style is catered to minimalism and typography. I work a lot with a monochromatic color <br>
  palette to visualize my imagery. Creating sleek and clean work is something I thoroughly enjoy doing. <br>
  So when I experience a creative slump, I am researching other minimalist work to create a spark in me.

<p class="copy"> GUNMAD is a design firm based in London. Their work heavily incoporates <br>
    typography and minimalism. I discovered GUNMAD's work a year ago, <br>
    while researching for inspiration. Their work really resonates with me and <br>
    I observe the types of techniques they use to create their designs. What <br>
    stuck out to me, was that most of their work always had black and white. <br>
    Although, color has been an important element in design. A lot of people <br>
    overlook the fact that good design is one that does not need color to <br>
    attract attention. Color is just a bonus! <br>
    <br>
    The difference between being "inspired" and "copying" is also important <br>
    to take note of. We want to respect the designers involved while  <br>
    incorporating our own ideas. Of course, a lot of designs and artwork have <br>
    been done before that our individual work is not as "unique" as we deem <br>
    it to be. However, we want to stay honest and dig deeper into our own <br>
    creativity to create even better designs. <br>
